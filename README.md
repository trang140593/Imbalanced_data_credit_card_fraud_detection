# Imbalanced_data_credit_card_fraud_detection

In this work, I work on the perpective of my last work dealing with the credit card fraund dection. The problem and data were taken on Kaggle website, let's take a look my last work.

We are gonna work on the new methods dealing with the imbalanced data. More particularly, we want to consider directly machine learning algorithms while crossing validation corresponding to random over-sampling and under-sampling which we will consider:

* Oversampling techniques SMOTE

* Undersampling techniques Tomek Links, ENN

However, I will consider the

* Hybridized Sampling
That means, first I will do SMOTE to over sampling randomly the miority class. Then I will apply Tomek Links or ENN to remove the instances of the both class whose prediction made by KNN method is different from the both class.

Have a nice reading and working!
